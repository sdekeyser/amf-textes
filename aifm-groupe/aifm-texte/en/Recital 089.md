(89) At the April 2009 summit in London, G20 Leaders agreed that hedge funds or their managers should be registered and should be required to disclose appropriate information on an ongoing basis to supervisors or regulators. They should be subject to oversight to ensure that they have adequate risk management. In June 2010, G20 Leaders in Toronto reaffirmed their commitment and also committed to accelerate the implementation of strong measures to improve transparency and regulatory oversight of hedge funds in an internationally consistent and non-discriminatory way. In order to support the G20 objectives, the International Organization of Securities Commissions issued high level principles of hedge fund oversight in June 2009 to guide the development of internationally consistent regulation in this area. On 16 September 2010 the European Council agreed on the need for Europe to promote its interest and values more assertively and in a spirit of reciprocity and mutual benefit in the context of the Union’s external relations and to take steps to, inter alia, secure greater market access for European business and deepen regulatory cooperation with major trade partners. The Commission will endeavour to ensure that these commitments are implemented in a similar way by the Union’s international partners.
