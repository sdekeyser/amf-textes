# Article 13 - Remuneration


1.   Member States shall require AIFMs to have remuneration policies and practices for those categories of staff, including senior management, risk takers, control functions, and any employees receiving total remuneration that takes them into the same remuneration bracket as senior management and risk takers, whose professional activities have a material impact on the risk profiles of the AIFMs or of the AIFs they manage, that are consistent with and promote sound and effective risk management and do not encourage risk-taking which is inconsistent with the risk profiles, rules or instruments of incorporation of the AIFs they manage.

The AIFMs shall determine the remuneration policies and practices in accordance with Annex II.

2.   ESMA shall ensure the existence of guidelines on sound remuneration policies which comply with Annex II. The guidelines shall take into account the principles on sound remuneration policies set out in Recommendation 2009/384/EC, the size of the AIFMs and the size of AIFs they manage, their internal organisation and the nature, the scope and the complexity of their activities. ESMA shall cooperate closely with the European Supervisory Authority (European Banking Authority) (EBA).
