# Article 52 - Disclosure of information to third countries


1.   The competent authority of a Member State may transfer to a third country data and the analysis of data on a case-by-case basis where the conditions laid down in Article 25 or 26 of Directive 95/46/EC are met and where the competent authority of the Member State is satisfied that the transfer is necessary for the purpose of this Directive. The third country shall not transfer the data to another third country without the express written authorisation of the competent authority of the Member State.
