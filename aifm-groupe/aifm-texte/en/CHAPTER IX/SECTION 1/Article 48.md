# Article 48 - Administrative penalties


1.   Member States shall lay down the rules on measures and penalties applicable to infringements of the national provisions adopted pursuant to this Directive and shall take all measures necessary to ensure that those rules are enforced. Without prejudice to the procedures for the withdrawal of authorisation or to the right of Member States to impose criminal penalties, Member States shall ensure, in accordance with their national law, that the appropriate administrative measures can be taken or administrative penalties be imposed against the persons responsible where the provisions adopted in the implementation of this Directive have not been complied with. Member States shall ensure that those measures are effective, proportionate and dissuasive.

2.   Member States shall provide that the competent authorities may disclose to the public any measure or penalty that will be imposed for infringement of the provisions adopted in the implementation of this Directive, unless such disclosure would seriously jeopardise the financial markets, be detrimental to the interests of the investors or cause disproportionate damage to the parties involved.

3.   ESMA shall draw up an annual report on the application of administrative measures and imposition of penalties in the case of breaches of the provisions adopted in the implementation of this Directive in the different Member States. Competent authorities shall provide ESMA with the necessary information for that purpose.
