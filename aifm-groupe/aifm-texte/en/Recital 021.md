(21) Management of AIFs should mean providing at least investment management services. The single AIFM to be appointed pursuant to this Directive should never be authorised to provide portfolio management without also providing risk management or vice versa. Subject to the conditions set out in this Directive, an authorised AIFM should not, however, be prevented from also engaging in the activities of administration and marketing of an AIF or from engaging in activities related to the assets of the AIF. An external AIFM should not be prevented from also providing the service of management of portfolios of investments with mandates given by investors on a discretionary, client-by-client basis, including portfolios owned by pension funds and institutions for occupational retirement provision which are covered by Directive 2003/41/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 June 2003 on the activities and supervision of institutions for occupational retirement provision (7), or from providing the non-core services of investment advice, safe-keeping and administration in relation to units of collective investment undertakings and reception and transmission of orders. Pursuant to authorisation under Directive 2009/65/EC, an external AIFM should be allowed to manage UCITS.
