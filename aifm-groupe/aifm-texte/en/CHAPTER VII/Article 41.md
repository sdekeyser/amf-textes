# Article 41 - Conditions for managing AIFs established in Member States other than the Member State of reference by non-EU AIFMs


1.   Member States shall ensure that an authorised non-EU AIFM may manage EU AIFs established in a Member State other than its Member State of reference either directly or via the establishment of a branch, provided that the AIFM is authorised to manage that type of AIF.

2.   Any non-EU AIFM intending to manage EU AIFs established in another Member State than its Member State of reference for the first time shall communicate the following information to the competent authorities of its Member State of reference:

(a) the Member State in which it intends to manage AIFs directly or establish a branch;

(b) a programme of operations stating in particular the services which it intends to perform and identifying the AIFs it intends to manage.

3.   If the non-EU AIFM intends to establish a branch, it shall provide, in addition to the information requested in paragraph 2, the following information:

(a) the organisational structure of the branch;

(b) the address in the home Member State of the AIF from which documents may be obtained;

(c) the names and contact details of persons responsible for the management of the branch.

4.   The competent authorities of the Member State of reference shall, within 1 month of receiving the complete documentation in accordance with paragraph 2 or within 2 months of receiving the complete documentation in accordance with paragraph 3, transmit that documentation to the competent authorities of the host Member States of the AIFM. Such transmission shall occur only if the AIFM’s management of the AIF complies and will continue to comply with this Directive and the AIFM otherwise complies with this Directive.

The competent authorities of the Member State of reference shall enclose a statement to the effect that the AIFM concerned is authorised by them.

The competent authorities of the Member State of reference shall immediately notify the AIFM about the transmission. Upon receipt of the transmission notification the AIFM may start to provide its services in the host Member States of the AIFM.

The competent authorities of the Member State of reference shall also inform ESMA that the AIFM may start managing the AIF in the host Member States of the AIFM.

5.   The host Member States of the AIFM shall not impose any additional requirements on the AIFM concerned in respect of the matters covered by this Directive.

6.   In the event of a change to any of the information communicated in accordance with paragraph 2 and, if relevant, paragraph 3, an AIFM shall give written notice of that change to the competent authorities of its Member State of reference at least 1 month before implementing a planned change, or immediately after an unplanned change has occurred.

If, pursuant to a planned change, the AIFM’s management of the AIF would no longer comply with this Directive or the AIFM would otherwise no longer comply with this Directive, the competent authorities of the Member State of reference shall inform the AIFM without undue delay that it is not to implement the change.

If a planned change is implemented notwithstanding the first and second subparagraphs or if an unplanned change has taken place pursuant to which the AIFM’s management of the AIF no longer complies with this Directive or the AIFM otherwise no longer complies with this Directive, the competent authorities of the Member State of reference shall take all due measures in accordance with Article 46, including, if necessary, the express prohibition of marketing of the AIF.

If the changes are acceptable because they do not affect the compliance of the AIFM’s management of the AIF with this Directive or the compliance by the AIFM with this Directive otherwise, the competent authorities of the Member State of reference shall without undue delay inform the competent authorities of the host Member States of the AIFM of those changes.

7.   In order to ensure consistent harmonisation of this Article, ESMA may develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the information to be notified in accordance with paragraphs 2 and 3.

Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.

8.   In order to ensure uniform conditions of application of this Article, ESMA may develop draft implementing technical standards to establish standard forms, templates and procedures for the transmission of information in accordance with paragraphs 2 and 3.

Power is conferred on the Commission to adopt the implementing technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.
