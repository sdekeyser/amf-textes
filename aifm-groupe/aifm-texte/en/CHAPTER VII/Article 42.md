# Article 42 - Conditions for the marketing in Member States without a passport of AIFs managed by a non-EU AIFM


1.   Without prejudice to Articles 37, 39 and 40, Member States may allow non-EU AIFMs to market to professional investors, in their territory only, units or shares of AIFs they manage subject at least to the following conditions:

(a) the non-EU AIFM complies with Articles 22, 23 and 24 in respect of each AIF marketed by it pursuant to this Article and with Articles 26 to 30 where an AIF marketed by it pursuant to this Article falls within the scope of Article 26(1). Competent authorities and AIF investors referred to in those Articles shall be deemed those of the Member States where the AIFs are marketed;

(b) appropriate cooperation arrangements for the purpose of systemic risk oversight and in line with international standards are in place between the competent authorities of the Member States where the AIFs are marketed, in so far as applicable, the competent authorities of the EU AIFs concerned and the supervisory authorities of the third country where the non-EU AIFM is established and, in so far as applicable, the supervisory authorities of the third country where the non-EU AIF is established in order to ensure an efficient exchange of information that allows competent authorities of the relevant Member States to carry out their duties in accordance with this Directive;

(c) the third country where the non-EU AIFM or the non-EU AIF is established is not listed as a Non-Cooperative Country and Territory by FATF.

Where a competent authority of an EU AIF does not enter into the required cooperation arrangements as set out in point (b) of the first subparagraph within a reasonable period of time, the competent authorities of the Member State where the AIF is intended to be marketed may refer the matter to ESMA which may act in accordance with the powers conferred on it under Article 19 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.

2.   Member States may impose stricter rules on the non-EU AIFM in respect of the marketing of units or shares of AIFs to investors in their territory for the purpose of this Article.

3.   The Commission shall adopt, by means of delegated acts in accordance with Article 56 and subject to the conditions of Articles 57 and 58, measures regarding the cooperation arrangements referred to in paragraph 1 in order to design a common framework to facilitate the establishment of those cooperation arrangements with third countries.

4.   In order to ensure uniform application of this Article, ESMA shall develop guidelines to determine the conditions of application of the measures adopted by the Commission regarding the cooperation arrangements referred to in paragraph 1.
