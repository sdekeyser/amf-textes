(64) After the entry into force of a delegated act adopted by the Commission in that regard, which will, in principle, taking into account advice given by ESMA, occur 2 years after the deadline for transposition of this Directive, a basic principle of this Directive should be that a non-EU AIFM is to benefit from the rights conferred under this Directive, such as to market units or shares of AIFs throughout the Union with a passport, subject to its compliance with this Directive. This should ensure a level playing field between EU and non-EU AIFMs. This Directive therefore provides for an authorisation applicable to non-EU AIFMs which will become applicable after the entry into force of the delegated act adopted by the Commission in this regard. To ensure that such compliance is enforced, the competent authorities of a Member State should enforce compliance with this Directive. For such non-EU AIFMs the competent supervisory authorities should be the competent authorities of the Member State of reference, as defined in this Directive.
