(20) Depending on their legal form, it should be possible for AIFs to be either externally or internally managed. AIFs should be deemed internally managed when the management functions are performed by the governing body or any other internal resource of the AIF. Where the legal form of the AIF permits internal management and where the AIFâ€™s governing body chooses not to appoint an external AIFM, the AIF is also AIFM and should therefore comply with all requirements for AIFMs under this Directive and be authorised as such. An AIFM which is an internally managed AIF should however not be authorised as the external manager of other AIFs. An AIF should be deemed externally managed when an external legal person has been appointed as manager by or on behalf of the AIF, which through such appointment is responsible for managing the AIF. Where an external AIFM has been appointed to manage a particular AIF, that AIFM should not be deemed to be providing the investment service of portfolio management as defined in point (9) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2004/39/EC, but, rather, collective portfolio management in accordance with this Directive.
