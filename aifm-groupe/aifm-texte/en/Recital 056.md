(56) Where an AIFM manages one or more AIFs which acquire control over a non-listed company, the AIFM should provide the competent authorities of its home Member State with information on the financing of the acquisition. That obligation to provide information on financing should also apply when an AIFM manages AIFs which acquire control over an issuer of shares admitted to trading on a regulated market.
