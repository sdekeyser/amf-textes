# Article 10 - Changes in the scope of the authorisation


1.   Member States shall require that AIFMs, before implementation, notify the competent authorities of their home Member State of any material changes to the conditions for initial authorisation, in particular material changes to the information provided in accordance with Article 7.

2.   If the competent authorities of the home Member State decide to impose restrictions or reject those changes, they shall, within 1 month of receipt of that notification, inform the AIFM. The competent authorities may prolong that period for up to 1 month where they consider this to be necessary because of the specific circumstances of the case and after having notified the AIFM accordingly. The changes shall be implemented if the relevant competent authorities do not oppose the changes within the relevant assessment period.
