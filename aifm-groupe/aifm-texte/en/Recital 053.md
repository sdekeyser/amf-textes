(53) Where AIFMs manage AIFs which exercise control over an issuer whose shares are admitted to trading on a regulated market, information should generally be disclosed in accordance with Directive 2004/25/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 on takeover bids (14) and Directive 2004/109/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 December 2004 on the harmonisation of transparency requirements in relation to information about issuers whose securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market (15). Specific requirements should apply to AIFMs managing AIFs which exercise control over a non-listed company. In order to ensure transparency regarding the controlled company, enhanced transparency, disclosure and reporting requirements should apply. Further, the annual reports of the relevant AIF should be supplemented with regard to the controlled company or such additional information should be included in the annual report of the controlled company. Such information should be made available to the employees’ representatives or, where there are none, the employees themselves, and to the investors of the relevant AIF.
