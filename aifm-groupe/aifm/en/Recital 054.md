(54) Specific information requirements towards employees of certain companies apply in cases where AIFs acquire control over such companies in accordance with this Directive. However, in most cases the AIFM has no control over the AIF, unless it is an internally managed AIF. Furthermore, there is, in accordance with the general principles of company law, no direct relationship between the shareholders and the employees’ representatives or, where there are none, the employees themselves. For those reasons, no direct information requirements towards the employees’ representatives or, where there are none, the employees themselves, can be imposed pursuant to this Directive on a shareholder or its manager, namely the AIF and the AIFM. As regards the information requirements towards such employees’ representatives or, where there are none, the employees themselves, this Directive should provide for an obligation on the AIFM concerned to use its best efforts to ensure that the board of directors of the company concerned discloses the relevant information to the employees’ representatives or, where there are none, the employees themselves.
