# Article 39 - Conditions for the marketing in the Union with a passport of EU AIFs managed by a non-EU AIFM


1.   Member States shall ensure that a duly authorised non-EU AIFM may market the units or shares of an EU AIF it manages to professional investors in the Union with a passport as soon as the conditions laid down in this Article are met.

2.   In case the AIFM intends to market units or shares of the EU AIF in its Member State of reference, the AIFM shall submit a notification to the competent authorities of its Member State of reference in respect of each EU AIF that it intends to market.

That notification shall comprise the documentation and information set out in Annex III.

3.   No later than 20 working days after receipt of a complete notification pursuant to paragraph 2, the competent authorities of the Member State of reference of the AIFM shall inform the AIFM whether it may start marketing the AIF identified in the notification referred to in paragraph 2 in its territory. The competent authorities of the Member State of reference of the AIFM may prevent the marketing of the AIF only if the AIFM’s management of the AIF does not or will not comply with this Directive or if the AIFM otherwise does not or will not comply with this Directive. In the case of a positive decision, the AIFM may start marketing the AIF in its Member State of reference as of the date of the notification by the competent authorities to that effect.

The competent authorities of the Member State of reference of the AIFM shall also inform ESMA and the competent authorities of the AIF that the AIFM may start marketing units or shares of the AIF in the Member State of reference of the AIFM.

4.   In case the AIFM intends to market units or shares of the EU AIF in Member States other than its Member State of reference, the AIFM shall submit a notification to the competent authorities of its Member State of reference in respect of each EU AIF that it intends to market.

That notification shall comprise the documentation and information set out in Annex IV.

5.   The competent authorities of the Member State of reference shall, no later than 20 working days after the date of receipt of the complete notification file referred to in paragraph 4, transmit the complete notification file to the competent authorities of the Member States where the units or shares of the AIF are intended to be marketed. Such transmission shall be effected only if the AIFM’s management of the AIF complies and will continue to comply with this Directive and if the AIFM otherwise complies with this Directive.

The competent authorities of the Member State of reference of the AIFM shall enclose a statement to the effect that the AIFM concerned is authorised to manage AIFs with a particular investment strategy.

6.   Upon transmission of the notification file, the competent authorities of the Member State of reference of the AIFM shall, without delay, notify the AIFM about the transmission. The AIFM may start marketing the AIF in the relevant host Member States as of the date of that notification.

The competent authorities of the Member State of reference of the AIFM shall also inform ESMA and the competent authorities of the AIF that the AIFM may start marketing the units or shares of the AIF in the host Member States of the AIFM.

7.   The arrangements referred to in point (h) of Annex IV shall be subject to the laws and supervision of the host Member States of the AIFM.

8.   Member States shall ensure that the notification letter by the AIFM referred to in paragraph 4 and the statement referred to in paragraph 5 are provided in a language customary in the sphere of international finance.

Member States shall ensure that electronic transmission and filing of the documents referred to in paragraph 6 are accepted by their competent authorities.

9.   In the event of a material change to any of the particulars communicated in accordance with paragraph 2 and/or 4, the AIFM shall give written notice of that change to the competent authorities of its Member State of reference at least 1 month before implementing a planned change, or immediately after an unplanned change has occurred.

If, pursuant to a planned change, the AIFM’s management of the AIF would no longer comply with this Directive or the AIFM would otherwise no longer comply with this Directive, the competent authorities of the Member State of reference of the AIFM shall inform the AIFM, without undue delay, that it is not to implement the change.

If a planned change is implemented notwithstanding the first and second subparagraphs or if an unplanned change has taken place pursuant to which the AIFM’s management of the AIF no longer complies with this Directive or the AIFM otherwise no longer complies with this Directive, the competent authorities of the Member State reference of the AIFM shall take all due measures in accordance with Article 46, including, if necessary, the express prohibition of marketing of the AIF.

If the changes are acceptable because they do not affect compliance of the AIFM’s management of the AIF with this Directive, or compliance by the AIFM with this Directive otherwise, the competent authorities of the Member State of reference shall, without delay, inform ESMA in so far as the changes concern the termination of the marketing of certain AIFs or additional AIFs being marketed and, in so far as applicable, the competent authorities of the host Member States of those changes.

10.   In order to ensure uniform conditions of application of this Article, ESMA may develop draft implementing technical standards to determine:

(a) the form and content of a model for the notification letter referred to in paragraphs 2 and 4;

(b) the form and content of a model for the statement referred to in paragraph 5;

(c) the form of the transmission referred to in paragraph 5; and

(d) the form of the written notice referred to in paragraph 9.

Power is conferred on the Commission to adopt the implementing technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.

11.   Without prejudice to Article 43(1), Member States shall require that the AIFs managed and marketed by the AIFM be marketed only to professional investors.
