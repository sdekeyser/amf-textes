(91) 4 years after the deadline for transposition of this Directive, the Commission should, on the basis of public consultation and in the light of the discussions with competent authorities, commence a review of the application and the scope of this Directive. That review should analyse the experience acquired in applying this Directive, its impact on investors, AIFs or AIFMs, in the Union and in third countries, and the extent to which the objectives of this Directive have been achieved, if necessary proposing appropriate amendments. That review should include a general survey of the functioning of the rules laid down in this Directive and the experience acquired in applying them. The Commission should in its review examine the functions of ESMA and the Union competent authorities in ensuring effective supervision of all AIFMs operating in the Union markets in the context of this Directive, including, inter alia – in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 – entrusting ESMA with further supervisory responsibilities in the field of authorisation and supervision of non-EU AIFMs. In this context the Commission should assess the costs and benefits of entrusting ESMA with such tasks.
