(57) Where an AIFM manages one or more AIFs which acquire control over a non-listed company or an issuer, the AIFM should, for a period of 24 months following the acquisition of control of the company by the AIFs, first, not be allowed to facilitate, support or instruct any distribution, capital reduction, share redemption and/or acquisition of own shares by the company in accordance with this Directive; second, in so far as the AIFM is authorised to vote on behalf of the AIFs at the meetings of governing bodies of the company, not vote in favour of a distribution, capital reduction, share redemption and/or acquisition of own shares by the company in accordance with this Directive; and third, in any event, use its best efforts to prevent distributions, capital reductions, share redemptions and/or the acquisition of own shares by the company in accordance with this Directive. When transposing this Directive into national law, the Member States should take into account the regulatory purpose of the provisions of Section 2 of Chapter V of this Directive and take due account in this context of the need for a level playing field between EU AIFs and non-EU AIFs when acquiring control in companies established in the Union.
