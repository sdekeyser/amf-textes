# Article 35 - Conditions for the marketing in the Union with a passport of a non-EU AIF managed by an EU AIFM


1.   Member States shall ensure that an authorised EU AIFM may market to professional investors in the Union units or shares of non-EU AIFs it manages and of EU feeder AIFs that do not fulfil the requirements referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 31(1) as soon as the conditions laid down in this Article are met.

2.   AIFMs shall comply with all the requirements established in this Directive, with the exception of Chapter VI. In addition the following conditions shall be met:

(a) appropriate cooperation arrangements must be in place between the competent authorities of the home Member State of the AIFM and the supervisory authorities of the third country where the non-EU AIF is established in order to ensure at least an efficient exchange of information, taking into account Article 50(4), that allows the competent authorities to carry out their duties in accordance with this Directive;

(b) the third country where the non-EU AIF is established is not listed as a Non-Cooperative Country and Territory by FATF;

(c) the third country where the non-EU AIF is established has signed an agreement with the home Member State of the authorised AIFM and with each other Member State in which the units or shares of the non-EU AIF are intended to be marketed, which fully complies with the standards laid down in Article 26 of the OECD Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital and ensures an effective exchange of information in tax matters, including any multilateral tax agreements.

Where a competent authority of another Member State disagrees with the assessment made on the application of points (a) and (b) of the first subparagraph by the competent authorities of the home Member State of the AIFM, the competent authorities concerned may refer the matter to the ESMA which may act in accordance with the powers conferred on it under Article 19 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.

3.   If an AIFM intends to market units or shares of non-EU AIFs in its home Member State, the AIFM shall submit a notification to the competent authorities of its home Member State in respect of each non-EU AIF that it intends to market.

That notification shall comprise the documentation and information set out in Annex III.

4.   No later than 20 working days after receipt of a complete notification pursuant to paragraph 3, the competent authorities of the home Member State of the AIFM shall inform the AIFM whether it may start marketing the AIF identified in the notification referred to in paragraph 3 in its territory. The competent authorities of the home Member State of the AIFM shall prevent the marketing of the AIF only if the AIFM’s management of the AIF does not or will not comply with this Directive or the AIFM otherwise does not or will not comply with this Directive. In the case of a positive decision, the AIFM may start marketing the AIF in its home Member State as of the date of the notification by the competent authorities to that effect.

The competent authorities of the home Member State of the AIFM shall also inform ESMA that the AIFM may start marketing the units or shares of the AIF in the home Member State of the AIFM.

5.   If an AIFM intends to market units or shares of non-EU AIFs in a Member State other than its home Member State, the AIFM shall submit a notification to the competent authorities of its home Member State in respect of each non-EU AIF that it intends to market.

That notification shall comprise the documentation and information set out in Annex IV.

6.   The competent authorities of the home Member State of the AIFM shall, no later than 20 working days after the date of receipt of the complete notification file referred to in paragraph 5, transmit that complete notification file to the competent authorities of the Member State where the AIF is intended to be marketed. Such transmission will occur only if the AIFM’s management of the AIF complies and will continue to comply with this Directive and that the AIFM otherwise complies with this Directive.

The competent authorities of the home Member State of the AIFM shall enclose a statement to the effect that the AIFM concerned is authorised to manage AIFs with a particular investment strategy.

7.   Upon transmission of the notification file, the competent authorities of the home Member State of the AIFM shall, without delay, notify the AIFM about the transmission. The AIFM may start marketing the AIF in the relevant host Member States of the AIFM as of the date of that notification by the competent authorities.

The competent authorities of the home Member State of the AIFM shall also inform ESMA that the AIFM may start marketing the units or shares of the AIF in the host Member States of the AIFM.

8.   Arrangements referred to in point (h) of Annex IV shall be subject to the laws and supervision of the host Member States of the AIFM.

9.   Member States shall ensure that the notification letter of the AIFM referred to in paragraph 5 and the statement referred to in paragraph 6 are provided in a language customary in the sphere of international finance.

Member States shall ensure that electronic transmission and filing of the documents referred to in paragraph 6 are accepted by their competent authorities.

10.   In the event of a material change to any of the particulars communicated in accordance with paragraph 3 or 5, the AIFM shall give written notice of that change to the competent authorities of its home Member State, at least 1 month before implementing a planned change, or immediately after an unplanned change has occurred.

If pursuant to a planned change, the AIFM’s management of the AIF would no longer comply with this Directive or the AIFM would no longer comply with this Directive, the competent authorities of the home Member State of the AIFM shall inform the AIFM without undue delay that it is not to implement the change.

If a planned change is implemented notwithstanding the first and second subparagraphs, or if an unplanned change has taken place pursuant to which the AIFM’s management of the AIF would no longer comply with this Directive or the AIFM otherwise would no longer comply with this Directive, the competent authorities of the home Member State of the AIFM shall take all due measures in accordance with Article 46, including, if necessary, the express prohibition of marketing of the AIF.

If the changes are acceptable because they do not affect the compliance of the AIFM’s management of the AIF with this Directive, or the compliance by the AIFM with this Directive otherwise, the competent authorities of the home Member State of the AIFM shall, without delay, inform ESMA in so far as the changes concern the termination of the marketing of certain AIFs or additional AIFs marketed and, if applicable, the competent authorities of the host Member States of the AIFM of those changes.

11.   The Commission shall adopt, by means of delegated acts in accordance with Article 56 and subject to the conditions of Articles 57 and 58, measures regarding the cooperation arrangements referred to in point (a) of paragraph 2 in order to design a common framework to facilitate the establishment of those cooperation arrangements with third countries.

12.   In order to ensure uniform application of this Article, ESMA may develop guidelines to determine the conditions of application of the measures adopted by the Commission regarding the cooperation arrangements referred to in point (a) of paragraph 2.

13.   ESMA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to determine the minimum content of the cooperation arrangements referred to in point (a) of paragraph 2 so as to ensure that both the competent authorities of the home and the host Member States receive sufficient information in order to be able to exercise their supervisory and investigatory powers under this Directive.

Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Article 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.

14.   In order to ensure consistent harmonisation of this Article, ESMA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the procedures for coordination and exchange of information between the competent authority of the home Member State and the competent authorities of the host Member States of the AIFM.

Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.

15.   In case a competent authority rejects a request to exchange information in accordance with the regulatory technical standards referred to in paragraph 14, the competent authorities concerned may refer the matter to ESMA, which may act in accordance with the powers conferred on it under Article 19 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.

16.   In order to ensure uniform conditions of application of this Article, ESMA may develop draft implementing technical standards to determine:

(a) the form and content of a model for the notification letter referred to in paragraph 3;

(b) the form and content of a model for the notification letter referred to in paragraph 5;

(c) the form and content of a model for the statement referred to in paragraph 6;

(d) the form of the transmission referred to in paragraph 6;

(e) the form of the written notice referred to in paragraph 10.

Power is conferred on the Commission to adopt the implementing technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.

17.   Without prejudice to Article 43(1), Member States shall require that the AIFs managed and marketed by the AIFM be marketed only to professional investors.
