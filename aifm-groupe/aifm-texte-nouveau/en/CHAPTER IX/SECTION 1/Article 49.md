# Article 49 - Right of appeal


1.   The competent authorities shall give written reasons for any decision to refuse or withdraw authorisation of AIFMs to manage and/or market AIFs, or any negative decision taken in the implementation of the measures adopted in application of this Directive, and communicate them to applicants.

2.   Member States shall provide that any decision taken under laws, regulations or administrative provisions adopted in accordance with this Directive is properly reasoned and is the subject of the right of appeal to the courts.

That right to appeal to the courts shall apply also where, in respect of an application for authorisation which provides all the information required, no decision is taken within 6 months of the submission of the application.
