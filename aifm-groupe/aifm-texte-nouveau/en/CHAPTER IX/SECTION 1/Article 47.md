# Article 47 - Powers and competences of ESMA


1.   ESMA may develop and regularly review guidelines for the competent authorities of the Member States on the exercise of their authorisation powers and on the reporting obligations by the competent authorities imposed by this Directive.

ESMA shall further have the powers necessary, including those enumerated in Article 48(3), to carry out the tasks attributed to it by this Directive.

2.   The obligation of professional secrecy shall apply to all persons who work or who have worked for ESMA, and for the competent authorities or for any other person to whom ESMA has delegated tasks, including auditors and experts contracted by ESMA. Information covered by professional secrecy shall not be disclosed to another person or authority except where such disclosure is necessary for legal proceedings.

3.   All the information exchanged under this Directive between ESMA, the competent authorities, EBA, the European Supervisory Authority (European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority) established by Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council (29) and the ESRB shall be considered confidential, except where ESMA or the competent authority or other authority or body concerned states at the time of communication that such information may be disclosed or where such disclosure is necessary for legal proceedings.

4.   In accordance with Article 9 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010, ESMA may, where all the conditions in paragraph 5 are met, request the competent authority or competent authorities to take any of the following measures, as appropriate:

(a) prohibit the marketing in the Union of units or shares of AIFs managed by non-EU AIFMs or of non-EU AIFs managed by EU AIFMs without the authorisation required in Article 37 or without the notification required in Articles 35, 39 and 40 or without being allowed to do so by the relevant Member States in accordance with Article 42;

(b) impose restrictions on non-EU AIFMs relating to the management of an AIF in case of excessive concentration of risk in a specific market on a cross-border basis;

(c) impose restrictions on non-EU AIFMs relating to the management of an AIF where its activities potentially constitute an important source of counterparty risk to a credit institution or other systemically relevant institutions.

5.   ESMA may take a decision under paragraph 4 and subject to the requirements set out in paragraph 6 if both of the following conditions are met:

(a) a substantial threat exists, originating or aggravated by the activities of AIFMs, to the orderly functioning and integrity of the financial market or to the stability of the whole or a part of the financial system in the Union and there are cross border implications; and

(b) the relevant competent authority or competent authorities have not taken measures to address the threat or the measures that have been taken do not sufficiently address the threat.

6.   The measures taken by the competent authority or competent authorities pursuant to paragraph 4 shall:

(a) effectively address the threat to the orderly functioning and the integrity of the financial market or to the stability of the whole or a part of the financial system in the Union or significantly improve the ability of competent authorities to monitor the threat;

(b) not create a risk of regulatory arbitrage;

(c) not have a detrimental effect on the efficiency of the financial markets, including reducing liquidity in those markets or creating uncertainty for market participants, in a way that is disproportionate to the benefits of the measures.

7.   Before requesting the competent authority to take or renew any measure referred to in paragraph 4, ESMA shall consult, where appropriate, the ESRB and other relevant authorities.

8.   ESMA shall notify the competent authorities of the Member State of reference of the non-EU AIFM and the competent authorities of the host Member States of the non-EU AIFM concerned of the decision to request the competent authority or competent authorities to impose or renew any measure referred to in paragraph 4. The notification shall at least specify the following details:

(a) the AIFM and the activities to which the measures apply and their duration;

(b) the reasons why ESMA is of the opinion that it is necessary to impose the measures in accordance with the conditions and requirements set out in this Article, including the evidence in support of those reasons.

9.   ESMA shall review its measures referred to in paragraph 4 at appropriate intervals and in any event at least every 3 months. If a measure is not renewed after that 3-month period, it shall automatically expire. Paragraphs 5 to 8 shall apply to a renewal of measures.

10.   The competent authorities of the Member State of reference of the non-EU AIFM concerned may request ESMA to reconsider its decision. The procedure set out in the second subparagraph of Article 44(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 shall apply.
