6.   Member States may authorise AIFMs not to provide up to 50 % of the additional amount of own funds referred to in paragraph 3 if they benefit from a guarantee of the same amount given by a credit institution or an insurance undertaking which has its registered office in a Member State, or in a third country where it is subject to prudential rules considered by the competent authorities as equivalent to those laid down in Union law.

7.   To cover potential professional liability risks resulting from activities AIFMs may carry out pursuant to this Directive, both internally managed AIFs and external AIFMs shall either:

(a) have additional own funds which are appropriate to cover potential liability risks arising from professional negligence; or

(b) hold a professional indemnity insurance against liability arising from professional negligence which is appropriate to the risks covered.

8.   Own funds, including any additional own funds as referred to in point (a) of paragraph 7, shall be invested in liquid assets or assets readily convertible to cash in the short term and shall not include speculative positions.
