# Article 37 - Authorisation of non-EU AIFMs intending to manage EU AIFs and/or market AIFs managed by them in the Union in accordance with Article 39 or 40


1.   Member States shall require that non-EU AIFMs intending to manage EU AIFs and/or to market AIFs managed by them in the Union in accordance with Article 39 or 40 acquire prior authorisation by the competent authorities of their Member State of reference in accordance with this Article.

2.   A non-EU AIFM intending to obtain prior authorisation as referred to in paragraph 1 shall comply with this Directive, with the exception of Chapter VI. If and to the extent that compliance with a provision of this Directive is incompatible with compliance with the law to which the non-EU AIFM and/or the non-EU AIF marketed in the Union is subject, there shall be no obligation on the AIFM to comply with that provision of this Directive if it can demonstrate that:

(a) it is impossible to combine such compliance with compliance with a mandatory provision in the law to which the non-EU AIFM and/or the non-EU AIF marketed in the Union is subject;

(b) the law to which the non-EU AIFM and/or the non-EU AIF is subject provides for an equivalent rule having the same regulatory purpose and offering the same level of protection to the investors of the relevant AIF; and

(c) the non-EU AIFM and/or the non-EU AIF complies with the equivalent rule referred to in point (b).

3.   A non-EU AIFM intending to obtain prior authorisation as referred to in paragraph 1 shall have a legal representative established in its Member State of reference. The legal representative shall be the contact point of the AIFM in the Union and any official correspondence between the competent authorities and the AIFM and between the EU investors of the relevant AIF and the AIFM as set out in this Directive shall take place through that legal representative. The legal representative shall perform the compliance function relating to the management and marketing activities performed by the AIFM under this Directive together with the AIFM.

4.   The Member State of reference of a non-EU AIFM shall be determined as follows:

(a) if the non-EU AIFM intends to manage only one EU AIF, or several EU AIFs established in the same Member State, and does not intend to market any AIF in accordance with Article 39 or 40 in the Union, the home Member State of that or those AIFs is deemed to be the Member State of reference and the competent authorities of this Member State will be competent for the authorisation procedure and for the supervision of the AIFM;

(b) if the non-EU AIFM intends to manage several EU AIFs established in different Member States and does not intend to market any AIF in accordance with Article 39 or 40 in the Union, the Member State of reference is either: (i) the Member State where most of the AIFs are established; or (ii) the Member State where the largest amount of assets is being managed;

(c) if the non-EU AIFM intends to market only one EU AIF in only one Member State, the Member State of reference is determined as follows: (i) if the AIF is authorised or registered in a Member State, the home Member State of the AIF or the Member State where the AIFM intends to market the AIF; (ii) if the AIF is not authorised or registered in a Member State, the Member State where the AIFM intends to market the AIF;

(d) if the non-EU AIFM intends to market only one non-EU AIF in only one Member State, the Member State of reference is that Member State;

(e) if the non-EU AIFM intends to market only one EU AIF, but in different Member States, the Member State of reference is determined as follows: (i) if the AIF is authorised or registered in a Member State, the home Member State of the AIF or one of the Member States where the AIFM intends to develop effective marketing; or (ii) if the AIF is not authorised or registered in a Member State, one of the Member States where the AIFM intends to develop effective marketing;

(f) if the non-EU AIFM intends to market only one non-EU AIF, but in different Member States, the Member State of reference is one of those Member States;

(g) if the non-EU AIFM intends to market several EU AIFs in the Union, the Member State of reference is determined as follows: (i) in so far as those AIFs are all registered or authorised in the same Member State, the home Member State of those AIFs or the Member State where the AIFM intends to develop effective marketing for most of those AIFs; (ii) in so far as those AIFs are not all registered or authorised in the same Member State, the Member State where the AIFM intends to develop effective marketing for most of those AIFs;

(h) if the non-EU AIFM intends to market several EU and non-EU AIFs, or several non-EU AIFs in the Union, the Member State of reference is the Member State where it intends to develop effective marketing for most of those AIFs.

In accordance with the criteria set out in points (b), (c)(i), (e), (f), and (g)(i) of the first subparagraph, more than one Member State of reference is possible. In such cases, Member States shall require that the non-EU AIFM intending to manage EU AIFs without marketing them and/or market AIFs managed by it in the Union in accordance with Article 39 or 40 submit a request to the competent authorities of all of the Member States that are possible Member States of reference in accordance with the criteria set out in those points, to determine its Member State of reference from among them. Those competent authorities shall jointly decide the Member State of reference for the non-EU AIFM, within 1 month of receipt of such request. The competent authorities of the Member State that is appointed as Member State of reference shall, without undue delay, inform the non-EU AIFM of that appointment. If the non-EU AIFM is not duly informed of the decision made by the relevant competent authorities within 7 days of the decision or if the relevant competent authorities have not made a decision within the 1-month period, the non-EU AIFM may itself choose its Member State of reference based on the criteria set out in this paragraph.

The AIFM shall be able to prove its intention to develop effective marketing in a particular Member State by disclosure of its marketing strategy to the competent authorities of the Member State indicated by it.

5.   Member States shall require that a non-EU AIFM intending to manage EU AIFs without marketing them and/or to market AIFs managed by it in the Union in accordance with Article 39 or 40 submit a request for authorisation to its Member State of reference.

After receiving the application for authorisation, the competent authorities shall assess whether the determination by the AIFM as regards its Member State of reference complies with the criteria laid down in paragraph 4. If the competent authorities consider that this is not the case, they shall refuse the authorisation request of the non-EU AIFM explaining the reasons for their refusal. If the competent authorities consider that the criteria of paragraph 4 have been complied with, they shall notify ESMA, requesting advice on their assessment. In their notification to ESMA, the competent authorities shall provide ESMA with the justification by the AIFM of its assessment regarding the Member State of reference and with information on the marketing strategy of the AIFM.

Within 1 month of having received the notification referred to in the second subparagraph, ESMA shall issue advice to the relevant competent authorities about their assessment on the Member State of reference in accordance with the criteria set out in paragraph 4. ESMA shall issue a negative advice only if it considers that the criteria set out in paragraph 4 have not been complied with.

The term referred to in Article 8(5) shall be suspended during ESMA’s deliberation in accordance with this paragraph.

If the competent authorities propose to grant authorisation contrary to ESMA’s advice referred to in the third subparagraph they shall inform ESMA, stating their reasons. ESMA shall publish the fact that the competent authorities do not comply or intend to comply with its advice. ESMA may also decide, on a case-by-case basis, to publish the reasons provided by the competent authorities for not complying with that advice. The competent authorities shall receive advance notice about such a publication.

If the competent authorities propose to grant authorisation contrary to ESMA’s advice referred to in the third subparagraph and the AIFM intends to market units or shares of AIFs managed by it in Member States other than the Member State of reference, the competent authorities of the Member State of reference shall also inform the competent authorities of those Member States thereof, stating their reasons. In so far as applicable, the competent authorities of the Member State of reference shall also inform the competent authorities of the home Member States of the AIFs managed by the AIFM thereof, stating their reasons.

6.   Where a competent authority of a Member State disagrees with the determination of the Member State of reference by the AIFM, the competent authorities concerned may refer the matter to the ESMA which may act in accordance with the powers conferred on it under Article 19 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.

7.   Without prejudice to paragraph 8, no authorisation shall be granted unless the following additional conditions are met:

(a) the Member State of reference is indicated by the AIFM in accordance with the criteria set out in paragraph 4 and supported by the disclosure of the marketing strategy, and the procedure set out in paragraph 5 has been followed by the relevant competent authorities;

(b) the AIFM has appointed a legal representative established in the Member State of reference;

(c) the legal representative shall, together with the AIFM, be the contact person of the non-EU AIFM for the investors of the relevant AIFs, for ESMA and for the competent authorities as regards the activities for which the AIFM is authorised in the Union and shall at least be sufficiently equipped to perform the compliance function pursuant to this Directive;

(d) appropriate cooperation arrangements are in place between the competent authorities of the Member State of reference, the competent authorities of the home Member State of the EU AIFs concerned and the supervisory authorities of the third country where the non-EU AIFM is established in order to ensure at least an efficient exchange of information that allows the competent authorities to carry out their duties in accordance with this Directive;

(e) the third country where the non-EU AIFM is established is not listed as a Non-Cooperative Country and Territory by FATF;

(f) the third country where the non-EU AIFM is established has signed an agreement with the Member State of reference, which fully complies with the standards laid down in Article 26 of the OECD Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital and ensures an effective exchange of information in tax matters, including any multilateral tax agreements;

(g) the effective exercise by the competent authorities of their supervisory functions under this Directive is neither prevented by the laws, regulations or administrative provisions of a third country governing the AIFM, nor by limitations in the supervisory and investigatory powers of that third country’s supervisory authorities.

Where a competent authority of another Member State disagrees with the assessment made on the application of points (a) to (e) and (g) of this paragraph by the competent authorities of the Member State of reference of the AIFM, the competent authorities concerned may refer the matter to the ESMA, which may act in accordance with the powers conferred on it under Article 19 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.

Where a competent authority of an EU AIF does not enter into the required cooperation arrangements as set out in point (d) of the first subparagraph within a reasonable period of time, the competent authorities of the Member State of reference may refer the matter to the ESMA which may act in accordance with the powers conferred on it under Article 19 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.

8.   The authorisation shall be given in accordance with Chapter II which shall apply mutatis mutandis subject to the following criteria:

(a) the information referred to in Article 7(2) shall be supplemented by: (i) a justification by the AIFM of its assessment regarding the Member State of reference in accordance with the criteria set out in paragraph 4 with information on the marketing strategy; (ii) a list of the provisions of this Directive for which compliance by the AIFM is impossible as compliance by the AIFM with those provisions is, in accordance with paragraph 2, incompatible with compliance with a mandatory provision in the law to which the non-EU AIFM or the non-EU AIF marketed in the Union is subject; (iii) written evidence based on the regulatory technical standards developed by ESMA that the relevant third country law provides for a rule equivalent to the provisions for which compliance is impossible, which has the same regulatory purpose and offers the same level of protection to the investors of the relevant AIFs and that the AIFM complies with that equivalent rule; such written evidence being supported by a legal opinion on the existence of the relevant incompatible mandatory provision in the law of the third country and including a description of the regulatory purpose and the nature of the investor protection pursued by it; and (iv) the name of the legal representative of the AIFM and the place where it is established;

(b) the information referred to in Article 7(3) may be limited to the EU AIFs the AIFM intends to manage and to those AIFs managed by the AIFM that it intends to market in the Union with a passport;

(c) point (a) of Article 8(1) shall be without prejudice to paragraph 2 of this Article;

(d) point (e) of Article 8(1) shall not apply;

Where a competent authority of another Member State disagrees with the authorisation granted by the competent authorities of the Member State of reference of the AIFM, the competent authorities concerned may refer the matter to the ESMA which may act in accordance with the powers conferred on it under Article 19 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.

9.   In case the competent authorities of the Member State of reference consider that the AIFM may rely on paragraph 2 to be exempted from compliance with certain provisions of this Directive, they shall, without undue delay, notify ESMA thereof. They shall support this assessment by the information provided by the AIFM in accordance with points (a)(ii) and (iii) of paragraph 8.

Within 1 month of receipt of the notification referred to in the first subparagraph, ESMA shall issue advice to the competent authorities about the application of the exemption for compliance with this Directive caused by the incompatibility in accordance with paragraph 2. The advice may, in particular, address whether the conditions for such exemption appear to be met based on the information provided by the AIFM in accordance with points (a)(ii) and (iii) of paragraph 8 and on the regulatory technical standards on equivalence. ESMA shall seek to build a common European supervisory culture and consistent supervisory practices and ensure consistent approaches among competent authorities in relation to the application of this paragraph.

The term referred to in Article 8(5) shall be suspended during the ESMA review in accordance with this paragraph.

If the competent authorities of the Member State of reference propose to grant authorisation contrary to ESMA’s advice referred to in the second subparagraph they shall inform ESMA, stating their reasons. ESMA shall publish the fact that the competent authorities do not comply or intend to comply with that advice. ESMA may also decide, on a case-by-case basis, to publish the reasons provided by the competent authorities for not complying with that advice. The competent authorities concerned shall receive advance notice of such publication.

If the competent authorities propose to grant authorisation contrary to the ESMA advice referred to in the second subparagraph and the AIFM intends to market units or shares of AIFs managed by it in Member States other than the Member State of reference, the competent authorities of the Member State of reference shall also inform the competent authorities of those Member States thereof, stating their reasons.

Where a competent authority of another Member State disagrees with the assessment made on the application of this paragraph by the competent authorities of the Member State of reference of the AIFM, the competent authorities concerned may refer the matter to the ESMA which may act in accordance with the powers conferred on it under Article 19 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.

10.   The competent authorities of the Member State of reference shall, without undue delay, inform ESMA of the outcome of the initial authorisation process, about any changes in the authorisation of the AIFM and any withdrawal of authorisation.

The competent authorities shall inform ESMA about the applications for authorisation that they have rejected, providing data about the AIFM having asked for authorisation and the reasons for the rejection. ESMA shall keep a central register of those data, which shall be at the disposal of competent authorities, on request. Competent authorities shall treat this information as confidential.

11.   The determination of the Member State of reference shall not be affected by the further business development of the AIFM in the Union. However, where the AIFM changes its marketing strategy within 2 years of its initial authorisation, and that change would have affected the determination of the Member State of reference if the modified marketing strategy had been the initial marketing strategy, the AIFM shall notify the competent authorities of the original Member State of reference of the change before implementing it and indicate its Member State of reference in accordance with the criteria set out in paragraph 4 and based on the new strategy. The AIFM shall justify its assessment by disclosing its new marketing strategy to its original Member State of reference. At the same time the AIFM shall provide information on its legal representative, including its name and the place where it is established. The legal representative shall be established in the new Member State of reference.

The original Member State of reference shall assess whether the determination of the AIFM in accordance with the first subparagraph is correct and shall notify ESMA thereof. ESMA shall issue advice on the assessment made by the competent authorities. In their notification to ESMA, the competent authorities shall provide the AIFM’s justification of its assessment regarding the Member State of reference and information on the AIFM’s new marketing strategy.

Within 1 month of receipt of the notification referred to in the second subparagraph, ESMA shall issue advice to the relevant competent authorities about their assessment. ESMA shall issue a negative advice only where it considers that the criteria set out in paragraph 4 have not been complied with.

After receipt of ESMA’s advice in accordance with the third subparagraph, the competent authorities of the original Member State of reference shall inform the non-EU AIFM, its original legal representative and ESMA of their decision.

Where the competent authorities of the original Member State of reference agree with the assessment made by the AIFM, they shall also inform the competent authorities of the new Member State of reference of the change. The original Member State of reference shall, without undue delay, transfer a copy of the authorisation and the supervision file relating to the AIFM to the new Member State of reference. From the date of transmission of the authorisation and supervision file, the competent authorities of the new Member State of reference shall be competent for authorising and supervising the AIFM.

Where the competent authorities’ final assessment is contrary to ESMA’s advice referred to in the third subparagraph:

(a) the competent authorities shall inform ESMA thereof, stating reasons. ESMA shall publish the fact that the competent authorities do not comply, or intend not to comply, with its advice. ESMA may also decide, on a case-by-case basis, to publish the reasons for non-compliance provided by the competent authorities. The competent authorities concerned shall receive advance notice of such publication;

(b) where the AIFM markets units or shares of AIFs managed by it in Member States other than the original Member State of reference, the competent authorities of the original Member State of reference shall inform the competent authorities of those other Member States thereof, stating reasons. Where applicable, the competent authorities of the Member State of reference shall also inform the competent authorities of the home Member States of the AIFs managed by the AIFM thereof, stating reasons.

12.   Where it appears from the actual course of the business development of the AIFM in the Union within 2 years after its authorisation that the marketing strategy as presented by the AIFM at the time of its authorisation was not followed, the AIFM made false statements in relation thereto or the AIFM has failed to comply with paragraph 11 when changing its marketing strategy, the competent authorities of the original Member State of reference shall request that the AIFM indicate the Member State of reference based on its actual marketing strategy. The procedure set out in paragraph 11 shall apply mutatis mutandis. If the AIFM does not comply with the competent authorities’ request, they shall withdraw its authorisation.

Where the AIFM changes its marketing strategy after the period referred to in paragraph 11 and intends to change its Member State of reference on the basis of its new marketing strategy, it may submit a request to change its Member State of reference to the competent authorities of the original Member State of reference. The procedure referred to in paragraph 11 shall apply mutatis mutandis.

Where a competent authority of a Member State disagrees with the assessment made on the determination of the Member State of reference under paragraph 11 or under this paragraph, the competent authorities concerned may refer the matter to the ESMA which may act in accordance with the powers conferred on it under Article 19 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.

13.   Any disputes arising between the competent authorities of the Member State of reference of the AIFM and the AIFM shall be settled in accordance with the law of and subject to the jurisdiction of the Member State of reference.
