(63) During a transitional period, which will, in principle, taking into account ESMAâ€™s advice, be brought to an end by means of a delegated act 3 years after the establishment of the passport for non-EU AIFMs, EU AIFMs intending to market non-EU AIFs in certain Member States, but without a passport, should also be permitted to do so by the relevant Member States, but only in so far as they comply with this Directive with the exception of the depositary requirements. Such EU AIFMs should, however, ensure that one or more entities are appointed to carry out the duties of the depositary. In addition, appropriate cooperation arrangements for the purpose of systemic risk oversight and in line with international standards should be in place between the competent authorities of the home Member State of the AIFM and the supervisory authorities of the third country where the non-EU AIF is established in order to ensure an efficient exchange of information that allows the competent authorities of the home Member State of the AIFM to carry out their duties in accordance with this Directive. The cooperation arrangements should not be used as a barrier to impede non-EU AIFs from being marketed in a Member State. Further, the third country where the non-EU AIF is established should not be listed as a Non-Cooperative Country and Territory by the Financial Action Task Force on anti-money laundering and terrorist financing (FATF).
