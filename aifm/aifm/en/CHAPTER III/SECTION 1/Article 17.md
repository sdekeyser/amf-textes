# Article 17 - Investment in securitisation positions


In order to ensure cross-sectoral consistency and to remove misalignment between the interest of firms that repackage loans into tradable securities and originators within the meaning of point (41) of Article 4 of Directive 2006/48/EC, and AIFMs that invest in those securities or other financial instruments on behalf of AIFs, the Commission shall adopt, by means of delegated acts in accordance with Article 56 and subject to the conditions of Articles 57 and 58, measures laying down the requirements in the following areas:

(a) the requirements that need to be met by the originator, the sponsor or the original lender, in order for an AIFM to be allowed to invest in securities or other financial instruments of this type issued after 1 January 2011 on behalf of AIFs, including requirements that ensure that the originator, the sponsor or the original lender retains a net economic interest of not less than 5Â %;

(b) qualitative requirements that must be met by AIFMs which invest in these securities or other financial instruments on behalf of one or more AIFs.
