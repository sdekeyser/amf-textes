(62) After the entry into force of a delegated act adopted by the Commission in this regard, which will, in principle, taking into account the advice provided by ESMA, occur 2 years after the deadline for transposition of this Directive, authorised EU AIFMs intending to market non-EU AIFs to professional investors in their home Member State and/or in other Member States should be allowed to do so with a passport in so far as they comply with this Directive. That right should be subject to notification procedures and conditions in relation to the third country of the non-EU AIF.
