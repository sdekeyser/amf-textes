3.   To that end, as from the entry into force of the delegated act referred to in Article 67(6) and until the issuance of the ESMA opinion referred to in point (a) of paragraph 1 of this Article, the competent authorities shall, quarterly, provide ESMA with information on the AIFMs that are managing and/or marketing AIFs under their supervision, either under the application of the passport regime provided for in this Directive, or under their national regimes.

4.   If ESMA considers that there are no significant obstacles regarding investor protection, market disruption, competition or the monitoring of systemic risk, impeding the termination of the national regimes pursuant to Articles 36 and 42 and making the passport for the marketing of non-EU AIFs by EU AIFMs in the Union and the management and/or marketing of AIFs by non-EU AIFM in the Union in accordance with the rules set out in Article 35 and Articles 37 to 41 the sole possible regime for such activities by the relevant AIFMs in the Union, it shall issue positive advice in this regard.

5.   The Commission shall adopt, by means of delegated acts in accordance with Article 56 and subject to the conditions of Articles 57 and 58, measures specifying the contents of the information to be provided pursuant to paragraph 2.

6.   The Commission shall adopt a delegated act within 3 months after having received positive advice and an opinion from ESMA and taking into account the criteria listed in paragraph 2 and the objectives of this Directive, such as those relating to the internal market, investor protection and the effective monitoring of systemic risk, in accordance with Article 56 and subject to the conditions of Articles 57 and 58, specifying the date when the national regimes set out in Articles 36 and 42 are to be terminated and the passport regime provided for in Article 35 and Articles 37 to 41 shall become the sole and mandatory regime applicable in all Member States.
