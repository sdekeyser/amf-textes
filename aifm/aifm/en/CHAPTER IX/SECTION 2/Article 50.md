# Article 50 - Obligation to cooperate


1.   The competent authorities of the Member States shall cooperate with each other and with ESMA and the ESRB whenever necessary for the purpose of carrying out their duties under this Directive or of exercising their powers under this Directive or under national law.

2.   Member States shall facilitate the cooperation provided for in this Section.

3.   Competent authorities shall use their powers for the purpose of cooperation, even in cases where the conduct under investigation does not constitute an infringement of any regulation in force in their own Member State.

4.   The competent authorities of the Member States shall immediately supply one another and ESMA with the information required for the purposes of carrying out their duties under this Directive.

The competent authorities of the home Member State shall forward a copy of the relevant cooperation arrangements entered into by them in accordance with Article 35, 37 and/or 40 to the host Member States of the AIFM concerned. The competent authorities of the home Member State shall, in accordance with procedures relating to the applicable regulatory technical standards referred to in Article 35(14), Article 37(17) or Article 40(14), forward the information received from third-country supervisory authorities in accordance with cooperation arrangements with such supervisory authorities in respect of an AIFM, or, where relevant, pursuant to Article 45(6) or (7), to the competent authorities of host Member State of the AIFM concerned.

Where a competent authority of a host Member State considers that the contents of the cooperation arrangement entered into by the home Member State of the AIFM concerned in accordance with Article 35, 37 and/or 40 does not comply with what is required pursuant to the applicable regulatory technical standards, the competent authorities concerned may refer the matter to the ESMA which may act in accordance with the powers conferred on it under Article 19 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.

5.   Where the competent authorities of one Member State have clear and demonstrable grounds to suspect that acts contrary to this Directive are being or have been carried out by an AIFM not subject to supervision of those competent authorities, they shall notify ESMA and the competent authorities of the home and host Member States of the AIFM concerned thereof in as specific a manner as possible. The recipient authorities shall take appropriate action, shall inform ESMA and the notifying competent authorities of the outcome of that action and, to the extent possible, of significant interim developments. This paragraph shall be without prejudice to the competences of the notifying competent authority.

6.   In order to ensure uniform application of this Directive concerning the exchange of information, ESMA may develop draft implementing technical standards to determine the conditions of application with regard to the procedures for exchange of information between competent authorities and between the competent authorities and ESMA.

Power is conferred on the Commission to adopt the implementing technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.
