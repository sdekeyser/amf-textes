# Article 33 - Conditions for managing EU AIFs established in other Member States


1.   Member States shall ensure that an authorised EU AIFM may manage EU AIFs established in another Member State either directly or by establishing a branch, provided that the AIFM is authorised to manage that type of AIF.

2.   An AIFM intending to manage EU AIFs established in another Member State for the first time shall communicate the following information to the competent authorities of its home Member State:

(a) the Member State in which it intends to manage AIFs directly or establish a branch;

(b) a programme of operations stating in particular the services which it intends to perform and identifying the AIFs it intends to manage.

3.   If the AIFM intends to establish a branch, it shall provide the following information in addition to that referred to in paragraph 2:

(a) the organisational structure of the branch;

(b) the address in the home Member State of the AIF from which documents may be obtained;

(c) the names and contact details of the persons responsible for the management of the branch.

4.   The competent authorities of the home Member State of the AIFM shall, within 1 month of receiving the complete documentation in accordance with paragraph 2 or within 2 months of receiving the complete documentation in accordance with paragraph 3, transmit the complete documentation to the competent authorities of the host Member State of the AIFM. Such transmission shall occur only if the AIFM’s management of the AIF complies, and will continue to comply, with this Directive and the AIFM otherwise complies with this Directive.

The competent authorities of the home Member State of the AIFM shall enclose a statement to the effect that the AIFM concerned is authorised by them.

The competent authorities of the home Member State of the AIFM shall immediately notify the AIFM about the transmission.

Upon receipt of the transmission notification the AIFM may start to provide its services in its host Member State.

5.   The host Member State of the AIFM shall not impose any additional requirements on the AIFM concerned in respect of the matters covered by this Directive.

6.   In the event of a change to any of the information communicated in accordance with paragraph 2, and, where relevant, paragraph 3, an AIFM shall give written notice of that change to the competent authorities of its home Member State at least 1 month before implementing planned changes, or immediately after an unplanned change has occurred.

If, pursuant to a planned change, the AIFM’s management of the AIF would no longer comply with this Directive or the AIFM would otherwise no longer comply with this Directive, the competent authorities of the home Member State of the AIFM shall inform the AIFM without undue delay that it is not to implement the change.

If a planned change is implemented notwithstanding the first and second subparagraphs or if an unplanned change has taken place pursuant to which the AIFM’s management of the AIF would no longer comply with this Directive or the AIFM otherwise would no longer comply with this Directive, the competent authorities of the home Member State of the AIFM shall take all due measures in accordance with Article 46.

If the changes are acceptable because they do not affect the compliance of the AIFM’s management of the AIF with this Directive, or the compliance by the AIFM with this Directive otherwise, the competent authorities of the home Member State of the AIFM shall, without undue delay, inform the competent authorities of the host Member States of the AIFM of those changes.

Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.

8.   In order to ensure uniform conditions of application of this Article, ESMA may develop draft implementing technical standards to establish standard forms, templates and procedures for the transmission of information in accordance with paragraphs 2 and 3.

Power is conferred on the Commission to adopt the implementing technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.
