# Article 32 - Marketing of units or shares of EU AIFs in Member States other than in the home Member State of the AIFM


1.   Member States shall ensure that an authorised EU AIFM may market units or shares of an EU AIF that it manages to professional investors in another Member State than the home Member State of the AIFM as soon as the conditions laid down in this Article are met.

Where the EU AIF is a feeder AIF the right to market referred to in the first subparagraph is subject to the condition that the master AIF is also an EU AIF and is managed by an authorised EU AIFM.

2.   The AIFM shall submit a notification to the competent authorities of its home Member State in respect of each EU AIF that it intends to market.

That notification shall comprise the documentation and information set out in Annex IV.

3.   The competent authorities of the home Member State of the AIFM shall, no later than 20 working days after the date of receipt of the complete notification file referred to in paragraph 2, transmit the complete notification file to the competent authorities of the Member States where it is intended that the AIF be marketed. Such transmission shall occur only if the AIFM’s management of the AIF complies with and will continue to comply with this Directive and if the AIFM otherwise complies with this Directive.

The competent authorities of the home Member State of the AIFM shall enclose a statement to the effect that the AIFM concerned is authorised to manage AIFs with a particular investment strategy.

4.   Upon transmission of the notification file, the competent authorities of the home Member State of the AIFM shall, without delay, notify the AIFM about the transmission. The AIFM may start marketing the AIF in the host Member State of the AIFM as of the date of that notification.

In so far as they are different, the competent authorities of the home Member State of the AIFM shall also inform the competent authorities of the AIF that the AIFM may start marketing the units or shares of the AIF in the host Member State of the AIFM.

5.   Arrangements referred to in point (h) of Annex IV shall be subject to the laws and supervision of the host Member State of the AIFM.

6.   Member States shall ensure that the notification letter by the AIFM referred to in paragraph 2 and the statement referred to in paragraph 3 are provided in a language customary in the sphere of international finance.

Member States shall ensure that electronic transmission and filing of the documents referred to in paragraph 3 are accepted by their competent authorities.

7.   In the event of a material change to any of the particulars communicated in accordance with paragraph 2, the AIFM shall give written notice of that change to the competent authorities of its home Member State at least 1 month before implementing a planned change, or immediately after an unplanned change has occurred.

If, pursuant to a planned change, the AIFM’s management of the AIF would no longer comply with this Directive or the AIFM would otherwise no longer comply with this Directive, the relevant competent authorities shall inform the AIFM without undue delay that it is not to implement the change.

If a planned change is implemented notwithstanding the first and second subparagraphs or if an unplanned change has taken place pursuant to which the AIFM’s management of the AIF would no longer comply with this Directive or the AIFM otherwise would no longer comply with this Directive, the competent authorities of the home Member State of the AIFM shall take all due measures in accordance with Article 46, including, if necessary, the express prohibition of marketing of the AIF.

If the changes are acceptable because they do not affect the compliance of the AIFM’s management of the AIF with this Directive, or the compliance by the AIFM with this Directive otherwise, the competent authorities of the home Member State of the AIFM shall, without delay, inform the competent authorities of the host Member State of the AIFM of those changes.

8.   In order to ensure uniform conditions of application of this Article, ESMA may develop draft implementing technical standards to determine:

(a) the form and content of a model for the notification letter referred to in paragraph 2;

(b) the form and content of a model for the statement referred to in paragraph 3;

(c) the form of the transmission referred to in paragraph 3; and

(d) the form of the written notice referred to in paragraph 7.

Power is conferred on the Commission to adopt the implementing technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.

9.   Without prejudice to Article 43(1), Member States shall require that the AIFs managed and marketed by the AIFM be marketed only to professional investors.
