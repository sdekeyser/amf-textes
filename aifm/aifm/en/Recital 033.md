(33) The provisions of this Directive relating to the appointment and the tasks of a depositary should apply to all AIFs managed by an AIFM subject to this Directive and therefore to all AIF business models. They should, however, be adapted to the specificities of different business models. For some business models certain depositary tasks are more relevant than for others, depending on the type of assets the AIFs are investing in and the tasks related to those assets.
