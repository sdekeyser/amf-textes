(6) Stabilisation of securities is intended to provide support for the price of an initial or secondary offering of securities during a limited time period if the securities come under selling pressure, thus alleviating sales pressure generated by short term investors and maintaining an orderly market in those securities. It thus contributes to greater confidence of investors and issuers in the financial markets. Therefore, in the interest of investors having subscribed or purchased the securities in the context of a significant distribution, and in the interest of the issuer, block trades that are strictly private transactions should not be considered a significant distribution of securities.
