The way in which persons who disseminate recommendations handle those recommendations may have an important impact on the evaluation of those by investors. In particular, the knowledge of the identity of the person disseminating the recommendation and the extent of alteration of the source recommendation can be a valuable piece of information for investors when considering their investment decisions.
