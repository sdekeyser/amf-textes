(4) Disclosure of valuations and methodologies is useful information in order to understand recommendations, as well as to gauge the extent to which the persons producing them are consistent in the valuations and methodologies they adopt. Recommendations produced by the same person and related to companies that belong to the same industry or to the same country should aim at consistently exhibiting some consistent common factors. For those reasons, independent analysts, investment firms, credit institutions, persons whose main business is to produce recommendations, and the natural persons working for them under a contract of employment or otherwise, as well as experts, should explain in the recommendations any change in the valuations and methodologies they use.
