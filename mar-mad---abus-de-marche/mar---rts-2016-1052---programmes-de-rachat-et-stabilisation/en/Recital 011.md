(11) In order to avoid confusion, stabilisation should be carried out in a manner that takes into account the market conditions and the offering price of the securities. Transactions to liquidate positions that were established as a result of stabilisation measures should be undertaken to minimise market impact, having due regard to prevailing market conditions. As the purpose of stabilisation is to support the price, selling securities that have been acquired through stabilising purchases, including selling in order to facilitate subsequent stabilising activity, should not be deemed to be for the purpose of price support. Neither those sales nor the subsequent purchases should be considered abusive in themselves even though they do not benefit from the exemption provided for under Regulation (EU) No 596/2014.
