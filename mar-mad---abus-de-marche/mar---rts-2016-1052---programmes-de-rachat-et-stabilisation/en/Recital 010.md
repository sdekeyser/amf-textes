(10) To provide resources and hedging for the stabilisation activity, ancillary stabilisation in the form of exercising overallotment facilities or greenshoe options should be allowed. However, it is important to set out conditions regarding the transparency of such ancillary stabilisation and the manner in which it is exercised, including the period during which it can be carried out. Moreover, particular attention should be paid to the exercise of an overallotment facility by an investment firm or a credit institution for the purpose of stabilisation when it results in a position that is not covered by the greenshoe option.
