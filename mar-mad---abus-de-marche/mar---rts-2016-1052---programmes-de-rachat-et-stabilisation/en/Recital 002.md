(2) All persons who produce or disseminate recommendations should have in place arrangements to ensure that information is objectively presented and interests or conflicts of interest are effectively disclosed. Moreover, additional arrangements should be made for those categories of persons who, by virtue of their nature and their activities, generally pose greater risks to market integrity and investor protection. That group would include independent analysts, investment firms, credit institutions, any person whose main business is to produce or disseminate recommendations, and the natural persons working for them under a contract of employment or otherwise, as well as other persons proposing investment decisions in respect of financial instruments who present themselves as having financial experience or expertise, or are perceived as such by market participants (hereinafter ‘experts’). Non-exhaustive indicators to be considered in relation to the identification of such experts include the frequency with which they produce recommendations; the number of followers they have when they propose recommendations; their personal work's history, including whether they have been professionally producing recommendations in the past; and whether their previous recommendations are or have been relayed by third parties, such as the media.
