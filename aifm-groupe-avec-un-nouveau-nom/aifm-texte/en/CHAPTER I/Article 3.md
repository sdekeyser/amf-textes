# Article 3 - Exemptions


1.   This Directive shall not apply to AIFMs in so far as they manage one or more AIFs whose only investors are the AIFM or the parent undertakings or the subsidiaries of the AIFM or other subsidiaries of those parent undertakings, provided that none of those investors is itself an AIF.

2.   Without prejudice to the application of Article 46, only paragraphs 3 and 4 of this Article shall apply to the following AIFMs:

(a) AIFMs which either directly or indirectly, through a company with which the AIFM is linked by common management or control, or by a substantive direct or indirect holding, manage portfolios of AIFs whose assets under management, including any assets acquired through use of leverage, in total do not exceed a threshold of EUR 100 million; or

(b) AIFMs which either directly or indirectly, through a company with which the AIFM is linked by common management or control, or by a substantive direct or indirect holding, manage portfolios of AIFs whose assets under management in total do not exceed a threshold of EUR 500 million when the portfolios of AIFs consist of AIFs that are unleveraged and have no redemption rights exercisable during a period of 5 years following the date of initial investment in each AIF.

3.   Member States shall ensure that AIFMs referred to in paragraph 2 at least:

(a) are subject to registration with the competent authorities of their home Member State;

(b) identify themselves and the AIFs that they manage to the competent authorities of their home Member State at the time of registration;

(c) provide information on the investment strategies of the AIFs that they manage to the competent authorities of their home Member State at the time of registration;

(d) regularly provide the competent authorities of their home Member State with information on the main instruments in which they are trading and on the principal exposures and most important concentrations of the AIFs that they manage in order to enable the competent authorities to monitor systemic risk effectively; and

(e) notify the competent authorities of their home Member State in the event that they no longer meet the conditions referred to in paragraph 2.

This paragraph and paragraph 2 shall apply without prejudice to any stricter rules adopted by Member States with respect to AIFMs referred to in paragraph 2.

Member States shall take the necessary steps to ensure that where the conditions set out in paragraph 2 are no longer met, the AIFM concerned applies for authorisation within 30 calendar days in accordance with the relevant procedures laid down in this Directive.

4.   AIFMs referred to in paragraph 2 shall not benefit from any of the rights granted under this Directive unless they choose to opt in under this Directive. Where AIFMs opt in, this Directive shall become applicable in its entirety.

5.   The Commission shall adopt implementing acts with a view to specifying the procedures for AIFMs which choose to opt in under this Directive in accordance with paragraph 4. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 59(2).

6.   The Commission shall adopt, by means of delegated acts in accordance with Article 56 and subject to the conditions of Articles 57 and 58, measures specifying:

(a) how the thresholds referred to in paragraph 2 are to be calculated and the treatment of AIFMs which manage AIFs whose assets under management, including any assets acquired through the use of leverage, occasionally exceed and/or fall below the relevant threshold in the same calendar year;

(b) the obligation to register and to provide information in order to allow effective monitoring of systemic risk as set out in paragraph 3; and

(c) the obligation to notify competent authorities as set out in paragraph 3.
