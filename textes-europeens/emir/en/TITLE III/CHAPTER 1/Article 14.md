2.   Once authorisation has been granted in accordance with Article 17, it shall be effective for the entire territory of the Union.

A CCP shall, without undue delay, notify the competent authority of any material changes affecting the conditions for authorisation.

5.   Authorisation referred to in paragraph 1 shall not prevent Member States from adopting or continuing to apply, in respect of CCPs established in their territory, additional requirements including certain requirements for authorisation under Directive 2006/48/EC.
