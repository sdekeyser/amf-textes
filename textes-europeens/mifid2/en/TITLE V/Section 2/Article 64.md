# Article 64 - Organisational requirements


1.   The home Member State shall require an APA to have adequate policies and arrangements in place to make public the information required under Articles 20 and 21 of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as close to real time as is technically possible, on a reasonable commercial basis. The information shall be made available free of charge 15 minutes after the APA has published it. The home Member State shall require the APA to be able to efficiently and consistently disseminate such information in a way that ensures fast access to the information, on a non-discriminatory basis and in a format that facilitates the consolidation of the information with similar data from other sources.

2.   The information made public by an APA in accordance with paragraph 1 shall include, at least, the following details:

(c) the volume of the transaction;

(d) the time of the transaction;

(e) the time the transaction was reported;

(f) the price notation of the transaction;

(h) if applicable, an indicator that the transaction was subject to specific conditions.

3.   The home Member State shall require the APA to operate and maintain effective administrative arrangements designed to prevent conflicts of interest with its clients. In particular, an APA who is also a market operator or investment firm shall treat all information collected in a non-discriminatory fashion and shall operate and maintain appropriate arrangements to separate different business functions.

4.   The home Member State shall require the APA to have sound security mechanisms in place designed to guarantee the security of the means of transfer of information, minimise the risk of data corruption and unauthorised access and to prevent information leakage before publication. The APA shall maintain adequate resources and have back-up facilities in place in order to offer and maintain its services at all times.

5.   The home Member State shall require the APA to have systems in place that can effectively check trade reports for completeness, identify omissions and obvious errors and request re-transmission of any such erroneous reports.

7.   The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 89 clarifying what constitutes a reasonable commercial basis to make information public as referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article.
