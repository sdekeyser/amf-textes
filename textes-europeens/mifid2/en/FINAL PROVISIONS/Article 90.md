# Article 90 - Reports and review


1.   Before 3 March 2019 the Commission shall, after consulting ESMA, present a report to the European Parliament and the Council on:

(a) the functioning of OTFs, including their specific use of matched principal trading, taking into account supervisory experience acquired by competent authorities, the number of OTFs authorised in the Union and their market share and in particular examining whether any adjustments are needed to the definition of an OTF and whether the range of financial instruments covered by the OTF category remains appropriate;

(b) the functioning of the regime for SME growth markets, taking into account the number of MTFs registered as SME growth markets, numbers of issuers present thereon, and relevant trading volumes; In particular, the report shall assess whether the threshold in point (a) of Article 33(3) remains an appropriate minimum to pursue the objectives for SME growth markets as stated in this Directive;

(c) the impact of requirements regarding algorithmic trading including high-frequency algorithmic trading;

(d) the experience with the mechanism for banning certain products or practices, taking into account the number of times the mechanisms have been triggered and their effects;

(e) the application of the administrative and criminal sanctions and in particular the need to further harmonise the administrative sanctions set out for the infringement of the requirements set out in this Directive and in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014;

(f) the impact of the application of position limits and position management on liquidity, market abuse and orderly pricing and settlement conditions in commodity derivatives markets;

(g) the development in prices for pre and post trade transparency data from regulated markets, MTFs, OTFs and APAs;

(h) the impact of the requirement to disclose any fees, commissions and non-monetary benefits in connection with the provision of an investment service or an ancillary service to the client in accordance with Article 24(9), including its impact on the proper functioning of the internal market on cross-border investment advice.

2.   The Commission shall, after consulting ESMA, present reports to the European Parliament and the Council on the functioning of the consolidated tape established in accordance with Title V. The report relating to Article 65(1) shall be presented by 3 September 2018. The report relating to Article 65(2) shall be presented by 3 September 2020.

The reports referred to in the first subparagraph shall assess the functioning of the consolidated tape against the following criteria:

(a) the availability and timeliness of post trade information in a consolidated format capturing all transactions irrespective of whether they are carried out on trading venues or not;

(b) the availability and timeliness of full and partial post trade information that is of a high quality, in formats that are easily accessible and usable for market participants and available on a reasonable commercial basis.

Where the Commission concludes that the CTPs have failed to provide information in a way that meets the criteria set out in the second subparagraph, the Commission shall accompany its report by a request to ESMA to launch a negotiated procedure for the appointment though a public procurement process run by ESMA of a commercial entity operating a consolidated tape. ESMA shall launch the procedure after receiving the request from the Commission on the conditions specified in the Commission’s request and in accordance with Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council (50).

3.   The Commission shall, where the procedure outlined in paragraph 2 is initiated, be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 89 amending Articles 59 to 65 and Section D of Annex I of this Directive and point (19) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014, by specifying measures in order to:

(a) provide for the contract duration of the commercial entity operating a consolidated tape and the process and conditions for renewing the contract and the launching of new public procurement;

(b) provide that the commercial entity operating a consolidated tape shall do so on an exclusive basis and that no other entity shall be authorised as a CTP in accordance with Article 59;

(c) empower ESMA to ensure adherence with tender conditions by the commercial entity operating a consolidated tape appointed through a public procurement;

(d) ensure that the post-trade information provided by the commercial entity operating a consolidated tape is of a high quality, in formats that are easily accessible and usable for market participants and in a consolidated format capturing the entire market;

(e) ensure that the post trade information is provided on a reasonable commercial basis, on both a consolidated and unconsolidated basis, and meets the needs of the users of that information across the Union;

(f) ensure that trading venues and APAs shall make their trade data available to the commercial entity operating a consolidated tape appointed through a public procurement process run by ESMA at a reasonable cost;

(g) specify arrangements applicable where the commercial entity operating a consolidated tape appointed through a public procurement fails to fulfil the tender conditions;

(h) specify arrangements under which CTPs authorised under Article 59 may continue to operate a consolidated tape where the empowerment provided for in point (b) of this paragraph is not used or, where no entity is appointed through the public procurement, until such time as a new public procurement is completed and a commercial entity is appointed to operate a consolidated tape.

4.   By 1 January 2018 the Commission shall prepare a report, after consulting ESMA and ACER, assessing the potential impact on energy prices and on the functioning of the energy market as well as the feasibility and the benefits in terms of reducing counterparty and systemic risks and the direct costs of C6 energy derivative contracts being made subject to the clearing obligation set out in Article 4 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, the risk mitigation techniques set out in Article 11(3) thereof and their inclusion in calculating the clearing threshold pursuant to Article 10 thereof.

If the Commission considers that it would not be feasible and beneficial to include those contracts, it shall submit, if appropriate, a legislative proposal to the European Parliament and the Council. The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 89 of this Directive to extend the 42-month period referred to in Article 95(1) of this Directive once by two years and a further time by one year.
