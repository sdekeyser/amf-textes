# Article 85 - Reports and review


1.   By 17 August 2015, the Commission shall review and prepare a general report on this Regulation. The Commission shall submit the report to the European Parliament and the Council, together with any appropriate proposals.

The Commission shall in particular:

(a) assess, in cooperation with the members of the ESCB, the need for any measure to facilitate the access of CCPs to central bank liquidity facilities;

(b) assess, in coordination with ESMA and the relevant sectoral authorities, the systemic importance of the transactions of non-financial firms in OTC derivatives and, in particular, the impact of this Regulation on the use of OTC derivatives by non-financial firms;

(c) assess, in the light of experience, the functioning of the supervisory framework for CCPs, including the effectiveness of supervisory colleges, the respective voting modalities laid down in Article 19(3), and the role of ESMA, in particular during the authorisation process for CCPs;

(d) assess, in cooperation with ESMA and ESRB, the efficiency of margining requirements to limit procyclicality and the need to define additional intervention capacity in this area;

(e) assess in cooperation with ESMA the evolution of CCP’s policies on collateral margining and securing requirements and their adaptation to the specific activities and risk profiles of their users.

The assessment referred to in point (a) of the first subparagraph shall take into account any result of ongoing work between central banks at Union and international level. The assessment shall also take into account the principle of independence of central banks and their right to provide access to liquidity facilities at their own discretion as well as the potential unintended effect on the behaviour of the CCPs or the internal market. Any accompanying proposals shall not, either directly or indirectly, discriminate against any Member State or group of Member States as a venue for clearing services.

2.   By 17 August 2014, the Commission shall prepare a report, after consulting ESMA and EIOPA, assessing the progress and effort made by CCPs in developing technical solutions for the transfer by pension scheme arrangements of non-cash collateral as variation margins, as well as the need for any measures to facilitate such solution. If the Commission considers that the necessary effort to develop appropriate technical solutions has not been made and that the adverse effect of centrally clearing derivative contracts on the retirement benefits of future pensioners remain unchanged, it shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 82 to extend the three-year period referred to in Article 89(1) once by two years and once by one year.

3.   ESMA shall submit to the Commission reports:

(a) on the application of the clearing obligation under Title II and in particular the absence of clearing obligation for OTC derivative contracts entered into before the date of entry into force of this Regulation;

(b) on the application of the identification procedure under Article 5(3);

(c) on the application of the segregation requirements laid down in Article 39;

(d) on the extension of the scope of interoperability arrangements under Title V to transactions in classes of financial instruments other than transferable securities and money-market instruments;

(e) on the access of CCPs to trading venues, the effects on competitiveness of certain practices, and the impact on liquidity fragmentation;

(f) on ESMA’s staffing and resources needs arising from the assumption of its powers and duties in accordance with this Regulation;

(g) on the impact of the application of additional requirements by Member States pursuant to Article 14(5).

Those reports shall be communicated to the Commission by 30 September 2014 for the purposes of paragraph 1. They shall also be submitted to the European Parliament and the Council.

4.   The Commission shall, in cooperation with the Member States and ESMA, and after requesting the assessment of the ESRB, draw up an annual report assessing any possible systemic risk and cost implications of interoperability arrangements.

The report shall focus at least on the number and complexity of such arrangements, and the adequacy of risk-management systems and models. The Commission shall submit the report to the European Parliament and the Council, together with any appropriate proposals.

The ESRB shall provide the Commission with its assessment of any possible systemic risk implications of interoperability arrangements.

5.   ESMA shall present an annual report to the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on the penalties imposed by competent authorities, including supervisory measures, fines and periodic penalty payments.
