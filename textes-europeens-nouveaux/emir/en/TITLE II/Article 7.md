# Article 7 - Access to a CCP


1.   A CCP that has been authorised to clear OTC derivative contracts shall accept clearing such contracts on a non-discriminatory and transparent basis, regardless of the trading venue.

A CCP may require that a trading venue comply with the operational and technical requirements established by the CCP, including the risk-management requirements.

2.   A CCP shall accede to or refuse a formal request for access by a trading venue within three months of such a request.

3.   Where a CCP refuses access under paragraph 2, it shall provide the trading venue with full reasons for such refusal.

4.   Save where the competent authority of the trading venue and that of the CCP refuse access, the CCP shall, subject to the second subparagraph, grant access within three months of a decision acceding to the trading venue’s formal request in accordance with paragraph 2.

The competent authority of the trading venue and that of the CCP may refuse access to the CCP following a formal request by the trading venue only where such access would threaten the smooth and orderly functioning of the markets or would adversely affect systemic risk.

5.   ESMA shall settle any dispute arising from a disagreement between competent authorities in accordance with its powers under Article 19 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.
