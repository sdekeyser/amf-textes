# Article 6 - Public register


1.   ESMA shall establish, maintain and keep up to date a public register in order to identify the classes of OTC derivatives subject to the clearing obligation correctly and unequivocally. The public register shall be available on ESMA’s website.

2.   The register shall include:

(a) the classes of OTC derivatives that are subject to the clearing obligation pursuant to Article 4;

(b) the CCPs that are authorised or recognised for the purpose of the clearing obligation;

(c) the dates from which the clearing obligation takes effect, including any phased-in implementation;

(d) the classes of OTC derivatives identified by ESMA in accordance with Article 5(3);

(e) the minimum remaining maturity of the derivative contracts referred to in Article 4(1)(b)(ii);

(f) the CCPs that have been notified to ESMA by the competent authority for the purpose of the clearing obligation and the date of notification of each of them.

3.   Where a CCP is no longer authorised or recognised in accordance with this Regulation to clear a given class of derivatives, ESMA shall immediately remove it from the public register in relation to that class of OTC derivatives.

4.   In order to ensure consistent application of this Article, ESMA may develop draft regulatory technical standards specifying the details to be included in the public register referred to in paragraph 1.

ESMA shall submit any such draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 30 September 2012.

Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.
