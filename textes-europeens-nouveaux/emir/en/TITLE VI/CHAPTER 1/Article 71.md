(b) obtained the registration by making false statements or by any other irregular means;

(c) no longer meets the conditions under which it was registered.

2.   ESMA shall, without undue delay, notify the relevant competent authority referred to in Article 57(1) of a decision to withdraw the registration of a trade repository.

Where ESMA decides not to withdraw the registration of the trade repository concerned, it shall provide full reasons.

4.   The competent authority referred to in paragraph 3 shall be the authority designated under Article 22.
