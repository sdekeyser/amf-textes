(a) trade repositories authorised in that third country comply with legally binding requirements which are equivalent to those laid down in this Regulation;

(b) effective supervision and enforcement of trade repositories takes place in that third country on an ongoing basis; and

That implementing act shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 86(2).

2.   Where appropriate, and in any case after adopting an implementing act as referred to in paragraph 1, the Commission shall submit recommendations to the Council for the negotiation of international agreements with the relevant third countries regarding mutual access to, and exchange of information on, derivative contracts held in trade repositories which are established in that third country, in a way that ensures that Union authorities, including ESMA, have immediate and continuous access to all the information needed for the exercise of their duties.

3.   After conclusion of the agreements referred to in paragraph 2, and in accordance with them, ESMA shall establish cooperation arrangements with the competent authorities of the relevant third countries. Those arrangements shall specify at least:
