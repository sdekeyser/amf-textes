# Article 23 - Significant fall in value for financial instruments other than liquid shares


1.   In respect of a share other than a liquid share, a significant fall in value during a single trading day compared to the closing price of the previous trading day means:

(a) a decrease in the price of the share of 10 % or more where the share is included in the main national equity index and is the underlying financial instrument for a derivative contract admitted to trading on a trading venue;

(b) a decrease in the price of the share of 20 % or more where the share price is EUR 0,50 or higher, or the equivalent in the local currency;

(c) a decrease in the price of the share of 40 % or more in all other cases.

2.   An increase of 7 % or more in the yield across the yield curve during a single trading day for the relevant sovereign issuer shall be considered a significant fall in value for a sovereign bond.

3.   An increase of 10 % or more in the yield of a corporate bond during a single trading day shall be considered a significant fall in value for a corporate bond.

4.   A decrease of 1,5 % or more in the price of a money-market instrument during a single trading day shall be considered a significant fall in value for a money-market instrument.

5.   A decrease of 10 % or more in the price of an exchange-traded fund during a single trading day shall be considered a significant fall in value for an exchange-traded fund, including exchange-traded funds that are UCITS. A leveraged exchange-traded fund shall be adjusted by the relevant leverage ratio to reflect a 10 % fall in the price of an equivalent unleveraged direct exchange-traded fund. A reverse exchange-traded fund shall be adjusted by a factor of -1 to reflect a 10 % fall in the price of an equivalent unleveraged direct exchange-traded fund.

6.   Where a derivative, including financial contracts for difference, is traded on a trading venue and has as its only underlying financial instrument, a financial instrument for which a significant fall in value is specified in this Article and Article 23(5) of Regulation (EU) No 236/2012, a significant fall in value in that derivative instrument shall be considered to have occurred when there has been a significant fall in that underlying financial instrument.
