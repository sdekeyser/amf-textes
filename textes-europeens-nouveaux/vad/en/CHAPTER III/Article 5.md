# Article 5 - Net short positions in shares — long positions


1.   The holding of a share through a long position in a basket of shares shall, in relation to that share, also be taken into account to the extent that that share is represented in that basket.

2.   Any exposure through a financial instrument other than the share which confers a financial advantage in the event of an increase in the price of the share as set out in Article 3(2)(b) of Regulation (EU) No 236/2012 means any exposure to share capital through any one or more of the instruments listed in Annex I, Part 1.

The exposure referred to in the first subparagraph depends on the value of the share in respect of which a net short position has to be calculated, and which confers a financial advantage in the event of an increase in the price or value of the share.
