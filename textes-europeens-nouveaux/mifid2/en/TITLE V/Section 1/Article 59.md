# Article 59 - Requirement for authorisation


1.   Member States shall require that the provision of data reporting services described in Annex I, Section D as a regular occupation or business be subject to prior authorisation in accordance with this Section. Such authorisation shall be granted by the home Member State competent authority designated in accordance with Article 67.

2.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1, Member States shall allow an investment firm or a market operator operating a trading venue to operate the data reporting services of an APA, a CTP and an ARM, subject to the prior verification of their compliance with this Title. Such a service shall be included in their authorisation.

3.   Member States shall register all data reporting services providers. The register shall be publicly accessible and shall contain information on the services for which the data reporting services provider is authorised. It shall be updated on a regular basis. Every authorisation shall be notified to ESMA.

ESMA shall establish a list of all data reporting services providers in the Union. The list shall contain information on the services for which the data reporting services provider is authorised and it shall be updated on a regular basis. ESMA shall publish and keep up-to-date that list on its website.

Where a competent authority has withdrawn an authorisation in accordance with Article 62, that withdrawal shall be published on the list for a period of 5 years.

4.   Member States shall require data reporting services providers to provide their services under the supervision of the competent authority. Member States shall ensure that competent authorities keep under regular review the compliance of data reporting services providers with this Title. They shall also ensure that competent authorities monitor that data reporting services providers comply at all times with the conditions for initial authorisation established under this Title.
