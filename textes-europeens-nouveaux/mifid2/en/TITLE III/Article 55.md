# Article 55 - Provisions regarding CCP and clearing and settlement arrangements


1.   Without prejudice to Titles III, IV or V of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, Member States shall not prevent regulated markets from entering into appropriate arrangements with a CCP or clearing house and a settlement system of another Member State with a view to providing for the clearing and/or settlement of some or all trades concluded by market participants under their systems.

2.   Without prejudice to Titles III, IV or V of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, the competent authority of a regulated market may not oppose the use of CCP, clearing houses and/or settlement systems in another Member State except where demonstrably necessary in order to maintain the orderly functioning of that regulated market and taking into account the conditions for settlement systems established in Article 37(2) of this Directive.

In order to avoid undue duplication of control, the competent authority shall take into account the oversight/supervision of the clearing and settlement system already exercised by the central banks as overseers of clearing and settlement systems or by other supervisory authorities with competence in relation to such systems.
