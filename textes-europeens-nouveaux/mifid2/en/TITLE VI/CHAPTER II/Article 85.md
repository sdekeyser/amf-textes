# Article 85 - Powers for host Member States


1.   Host Member States shall provide that the competent authority may, for statistical purposes, require all investment firms with branches within their territories to report to them periodically on the activities of those branches.

2.   In discharging their responsibilities under this Directive, host Member States shall provide that the competent authority may require branches of investment firms to provide the information necessary for the monitoring of their compliance with the standards set by the host Member State that apply to them for the cases provided for in Article 35(8). Those requirements may not be more stringent than those which the same Member State imposes on established firms for the monitoring of their compliance with the same standards.
