# Article 86 - Precautionary measures to be taken by host Member States


1.   Where the competent authority of the host Member State has clear and demonstrable grounds for believing that an investment firm acting within its territory under the freedom to provide services infringes the obligations arising from the provisions adopted pursuant to this Directive or that an investment firm that has a branch within its territory infringes the obligations arising from the provisions adopted pursuant to this Directive which do not confer powers on the competent authority of the host Member State, it shall refer those findings to the competent authority of the home Member State.

If, despite the measures taken by the competent authority of the home Member State or because such measures prove inadequate, the investment firm persists in acting in a manner that is clearly prejudicial to the interests of host Member State investors or the orderly functioning of markets, the following shall apply:

(a) after informing the competent authority of the home Member State, the competent authority of the host Member State shall take all the appropriate measures needed in order to protect investors and the proper functioning of the markets, which shall include the possibility of preventing offending investment firms from initiating any further transactions within their territories. The Commission and ESMA shall be informed of such measures without undue delay; and

(b) the competent authority of the host Member State may refer the matter to ESMA, which may act in accordance with the powers conferred on it under Article 19 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.

2.   Where the competent authorities of a host Member State ascertain that an investment firm that has a branch within its territory infringes the legal or regulatory provisions adopted in that Member State pursuant to those provisions of this Directive which confer powers on the host Member State’s competent authorities, those authorities shall require the investment firm concerned to put an end to its irregular situation.

If the investment firm concerned fails to take the necessary steps, the competent authorities of the host Member State shall take all appropriate measures to ensure that the investment firm concerned puts an end to its irregular situation. The nature of those measures shall be communicated to the competent authorities of the home Member State.

Where, despite the measures taken by the host Member State, the investment firm persists in infringing the legal or regulatory provisions referred to in the first subparagraph in force in the host Member State, the competent authority of the host Member State shall, after informing the competent authority of the home Member State, take all the appropriate measures needed in order to protect investors and the proper functioning of the markets. The Commission and ESMA shall be informed of such measures without undue delay.

In addition, the competent authority of the host Member State may refer the matter to ESMA, which may act in accordance with the powers conferred on it under Article 19 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.

3.   Where the competent authority of the host Member State of a regulated market, an MTF or OTF has clear and demonstrable grounds for believing that such regulated market, MTF or OTF infringes the obligations arising from the provisions adopted pursuant to this Directive, it shall refer those findings to the competent authority of the home Member State of the regulated market or the MTF or OTF.

Where, despite the measures taken by the competent authority of the home Member State or because such measures prove inadequate, that regulated market or the MTF or OTF persists in acting in a manner that is clearly prejudicial to the interests of host Member State investors or the orderly functioning of markets, the competent authority of the host Member State shall, after informing the competent authority of the home Member State, take all the appropriate measures needed in order to protect investors and the proper functioning of the markets, which shall include the possibility of preventing that regulated market or the MTF or OTF from making their arrangements available to remote members or participants established in the host Member State. The Commission and ESMA shall be informed of such measures without undue delay.

In addition, the competent authority of the host Member State may refer the matter to ESMA, which may act in accordance with the powers conferred on it under Article 19 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.

4.   Any measure adopted pursuant to paragraphs 1, 2 or 3 involving sanctions or restrictions on the activities of an investment firm or of a regulated market shall be properly justified and communicated to the investment firm or to the regulated market concerned.
