(67) The Authority should assume all current tasks and powers of the Committee of European Securities Regulators. Commission Decision 2009/77/EC should therefore be repealed on the date of the establishment of the Authority and Decision No 716/2009/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 September 2009 establishing a Community programme to support specific activities in the field of financial services, financial reporting and auditing (43), should be amended accordingly. Given the existing structures and operations of the Committee of European Securities Regulators, it is important to ensure very close cooperation between the Committee of European Securities Regulators and the Commission when establishing appropriate transitional arrangements, to ensure that the period during which the Commission is responsible for the administrative establishment and initial administrative operation of the Authority be as limited as possible.
