# Article 32 - Assessment of market developments


1.   The Authority shall monitor and assess market developments in the area of its competence and, where necessary, inform the European Supervisory Authority (European Banking Authority), and the European Supervisory Authority (European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority), the ESRB and the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission about the relevant micro-prudential trends, potential risks and vulnerabilities. The Authority shall include in its assessments an economic analysis of the markets in which financial market participants operate, and an assessment of the impact of potential market developments on such financial market participants.

2.   The Authority shall, in cooperation with the ESRB, initiate and coordinate Union-wide assessments of the resilience of financial market participants to adverse market developments. To that end, it shall develop the following, for application by the competent authorities:

(a) common methodologies for assessing the effect of economic scenarios on the financial position of a financial market participant;

(b) common approaches to communication on the outcomes of these assessments of the resilience of financial market participants;

(c) common methodologies for assessing the effect of particular products or distribution processes on the financial position of a financial market participant and on investors and customer information.

3.   Without prejudice to the tasks of the ESRB set out in Regulation (EU) No 1092/2010, the Authority shall, at least once a year, and more frequently as necessary, provide assessments to the European Parliament, the Council, the Commission and the ESRB of trends, potential risks and vulnerabilities in its area of competence.

The Authority shall include a classification of the main risks and vulnerabilities in these assessments and, where necessary, recommend preventative or remedial actions.

4.   The Authority shall ensure an adequate coverage of cross-sectoral developments, risks and vulnerabilities by closely cooperating with the European Supervisory Authority (European Banking Authority) and the European Supervisory Authority (European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority) through the Joint Committee.
