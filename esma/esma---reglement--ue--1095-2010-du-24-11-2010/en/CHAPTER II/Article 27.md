# Article 27 - European system of resolution and funding arrangements


1.   In the areas of its competence, the Authority shall contribute to developing methods for the resolution of failing key financial market participants in ways which avoid contagion, allow them to be wound down in an orderly and timely manner, and, where applicable, including coherent and credible funding mechanisms as appropriate.

2.   The Authority shall contribute to the work on the level playing field issues and cumulative impacts of any systems of levies and contributions on financial institutions that may be introduced to ensure fair burden sharing and incentives to contain systemic risk as a part of a coherent and credible resolution framework.

The review of this Regulation provided for in Article 81 shall in particular examine the possible enhancement of the role of the Authority in a framework of crisis prevention, management and resolution.
