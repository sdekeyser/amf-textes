(5) The European Council, in its conclusions of 19 June 2009, confirmed that a European System of Financial Supervisors, comprising three new European Supervisory Authorities, should be established. The system should be aimed at upgrading the quality and consistency of national supervision, strengthening oversight of cross-border groups and establishing a European single rule book applicable to all financial market participants in the internal market. It emphasised that the European Supervisory Authorities should also have supervisory powers in relation to credit rating agencies and invited the Commission to prepare concrete proposals on how the European System of Financial Supervisors could play a strong role in crisis situations, while stressing that decisions taken by the European Supervisory Authorities should not impinge on the fiscal responsibilities of Member States. The Commission has presented a Proposal for a Regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 September 2009 on credit rating agencies (11). The European Parliament and the Council should consider that proposal in order to ensure that European Supervisory Authority (European Securities and Markets Authority) (hereinafter the Authority’) will have adequate supervisory powers over credit rating agencies, bearing in mind that the Authority should execute exclusive supervisory powers over Credit Rating Agencies entrusted to it in Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009. For that purpose, the Authority should have appropriate powers of investigation and enforcement as specified in the relevant legislation, as well as the possibility of charging fees.
