In addition to the Authority, a European Supervisory Authority (European Banking Authority) and a European Supervisory Authority (European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority) as well as a Joint Committee of the European Supervisory Authorities (hereinafter the Joint Committee’) should be established.
