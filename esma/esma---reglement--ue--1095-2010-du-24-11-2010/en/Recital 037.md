(37) In the areas of its competence, the Authority should contribute to, and participate actively in the development and coordination of effective and consistent recovery and resolution plans, procedures in emergency situations and preventive measures to ensure the internalisation of costs by the financial system, in order to minimise the systemic impact of any failure and the reliance on taxpayer funds to bail out financial market participants. It should contribute to developing methods for the resolution of failing key financial market participants in ways which avoid contagion, which allow them to be wound down in an orderly and timely manner, and which, where applicable, include coherent and credible funding mechanisms as appropriate.
